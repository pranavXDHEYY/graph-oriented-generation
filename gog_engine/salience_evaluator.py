The Neuro-Symbolic "Salience Membrane".

Background
----------
Graph-Oriented Generation (GOG) isolates a precise topological sub-graph of
files relevant to a given prompt.  This is strictly better than Vector RAG for
architectural tasks because the DAG is built from real import statements — it
cannot hallucinate relationships that do not exist in source code.

However, GOG on its own is a *retrieval* guarantee, not a *generation* guarantee.
Even with a perfectly curated context, an LLM can still emit code that imports
beyond the provided boundary — a condition we call an "architectural
hallucination".

This module implements the Salience Membrane: the deterministic filter that
separates the LLM's stochastic output space from the downstream build system.

Neuro-Symbolic Architecture
---------------------------
The term "Neuro-Symbolic" describes a hybrid AI system combining:

  • Neuro (Neural LLM)  —  creative, stochastic.  Writes code, generalises
                            patterns.  Can hallucinate imports.
  • Symbolic (SRM Graph) —  deterministic, ground-truth.  Every edge is a
                            real `import` statement from source code.  Cannot
                            hallucinate.

The Membrane sits at the boundary.  It:
  1. Accepts  LLM output whose proposed imports all resolve to `allowed_nodes`.
  2. Rejects  LLM output that attempts to reach outside the graph boundary,
              returning a human-readable reason so the calling loop can build a
              corrective prompt and retry (Rejection Sampling).

Rejection Sampling
------------------
"Rejection Sampling" is a Monte Carlo technique: draw a sample, test a
constraint, discard failures, draw again.  Here::

    sample      = one LLM response
    distribution = the LLM's generative output space (temperature-driven)
    constraint  = the GOG symbolic dependency graph

The LLM is trapped in a corrective feedback loop until it produces a
topologically valid response or exhausts `max_attempts`.  Each rejection
injecting the specific illegal import names steers the model toward compliance
on the next draw.

AST / Regex Dual-Layer Extraction
----------------------------------
Import extraction uses two layers:

  1. Primary: tree-sitter AST via `TypeScriptParser.extract_imports()`.
     Structurally precise but has a known quirk: it silently returns `[]` for
     files missing a trailing newline (tree-sitter does not parse the last
     AST node if the file is not newline-terminated).  We always append `\\n`
     before writing the temp file to work around this.

  2. Fallback: module-level `_IMPORT_RE` regex.  If the AST yields zero
     results but the code string contains the word `import`, we fall back to
     regex extraction — the same defensive pattern already used in
     `ast_parser.py`.  This prevents the most dangerous failure mode:
     silently accepting a hallucinated import because the parser had nothing
     to report.

Contributing
------------
See CONTRIBUTING.md for code style and testing guidance.
All new language parsers should expose the same `extract_imports(file_path)`
interface as `TypeScriptParser` so this evaluator can accept them as a
drop-in `self.parser`.

        Deterministically corrects a failed EvaluationResult without a second
        LLM call.

        This is the core of the Neuro-Symbolic architecture: the LLM generates
        freely (creativity), and the SRM graph corrects any topological errors
        (determinism).  The graph is the ground truth — we never need to ask
        the LLM to guess the right import path when we already know it.

        Algorithm
        ---------
        For each illegal import specifier in ``result.violations``:
          1. Extract its basename (e.g. ``../../utils/httpUtils`` → ``httpUtils``).
          2. Find the matching absolute path in ``allowed_nodes`` by basename.
          3. Compute the correct relative import path from a generic src root.
          4. Replace the illegal specifier in the extracted code with the
             correct one using a targeted regex substitution.

        If no match is found in ``allowed_nodes`` for a violation (i.e., the
        LLM hallucinated a file that genuinely doesn't exist anywhere in the
        graph), the illegal import line is commented out with a diagnostic
        annotation so the output remains syntactically valid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        result:
            An ``EvaluationResult`` with ``is_valid=False`` from ``evaluate()``.
            If ``is_valid=True``, the original ``extracted_code`` is returned
