# GOG Benchmark (Graph-Oriented Generation)

This repository evaluates the efficiency of **Symbolic Reasoning Model (SRM)** context isolation (GOG) compared to standard **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for large codebase understanding.

## Architecture

*   **Python Engine:** Orchestrates the benchmark, parses the codebase, and interacts with the LLM API.
*   **SRM Engine:** Uses `networkx` to build a dependency graph of the codebase and isolate relevant files for a given prompt.
*   **Benchmark Harness:** A/B tests the context load and execution time between a full codebase dump (RAG) and isolated context (GOG).

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Install OpenCode CLI:**
    The benchmarking suite uses the `opencode` CLI for all LLM interactions. Install it via NPM:
    ```bash
    npm install -g opencode
    ```

3.  **Generate the Maze:**
    Inflate the target repository with 50+ dummy files and a hidden "needle" component.
    ```bash
    python3 generate_dummy_repo.py
    ```

## Running the Benchmark

There are two primary ways to run the benchmark: via the Cloud-based OpenCode CLI or purely locally using an open-source Small Language Model (SLM) via Ollama.

### 1. Cloud Execution (OpenCode CLI)
Use this method to benchmark performance using state-of-the-art cloud models.

```bash
python3 benchmark_cloud_cli.py
```

### 2. Local SLM Execution (Ollama)
Use this method to prove that GOG is so efficient that it can run entirely on local resources using small models like `qwen`. This removes API latency and costs completely.

**Install Ollama & Prepare the Model:**
1. Download mapping and install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) or run:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```
2. Pull the specified local LLM (e.g. `qwen3.5:0.8b` or whichever you prefer):
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3.5:0.8b
   ```
3. Run the local benchmark:
   ```bash
   python3 benchmark_local_llm.py
   ```

## Expected Results

The SRM Engine should demonstrate a **70%+ reduction in token usage on average** by deterministically tracing the precise dependency paths, ignoring the dozens of noise components that plague typical Vector RAG setups. Furthermore, the Local Compute Time metric will highlight the fundamental difference in overhead between $O(n)$ vector scaling and $O(1)$ graph traversal.
